1.write a blog on the difference between document and window object
           
    •	The document and window objects are two of the most          
      important objects in JavaScript. They are often used interchangeably,  
      but there are some key differences between them. 
                    
    •	The document object represents the HTML document that is being displayed in 
      the browser. It contains all of the elements in the document, as well as
      their attributes and values. The document object can be used to manipulate 
      the contents of the document, such as adding or removing elements, changing 
      their attributes, and reading or writing their values.

    •	The window object represents the browser window that is displaying the
      document. It contains information about the window, such as its size, 
      position, and scroll position. The window object also contains references 
      to other objects, such as the document object, the location object, and the
      history object.
